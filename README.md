## ChatGPT

Before designing the code that will generate our melodies I asked chatGPT to generate some of its own using this initial prompt:

\*Write an array that will be used to generate random melodies based on the following constraints:

Key: E minor
Scale: Natural minor
Tempo: 120 bpm
Time signature: 4/4
Maximum range: 3 octaves
Use integers to represent the notes, with 0 being the lowest E note, 1 being F, 2 being F#, and so on, up to 11 being D# and 12 being a E note one octave higher than 0
Use '-' to represent rests
Use a combination of eighth notes, quarter notes, and half notes to create the melody
The melody should be at least 8 bars long
Use repetition and variation to create a memorable and interesting melody
Harmonize the melody with appropriate chords
The program should output the melody as an array of integers and dashes representing the notes and rests, respectively. Additionally, provide a brief explanation of the music techniques used to create the melody, including the rhythm, phrasing, and harmonization.\*
